Evaluation
we just test the models with ISIC 2018 dataset. The dataset was split into three subsets, training set, validation set, and test set, which the proportion is 70%, 10% and 20% of the whole dataset, respectively. The entire dataset contains 2594 images where 1815 images were used for training, 259 for validation and 520 for testing models.
